				"rationale": "Complex projects are usually initiated to implement long range strategies in contexts of high complexity and uncertainty, where project outcomes are often emergent. This unit examines strategic and systems concepts and frameworks that will help the complex project manager to understand a project's strategic context and develop project strategies capable of delivering successful project outcomes. Strategic management competencies are developed through the application of strategic and systems concepts and frameworks to real-life case studies of complex projects. Project leaders need to understand the character of project complexity, strategic alignment and the challenges it presents. They also need innovative but frequently non-traditional development and delivery methodologies to meet these challenges. In particular they will be cognizant of uncertainty and be able to develop and implement complex projects to deal with emergence.",
